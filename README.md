# tmux-dirsesh

`dirsesh` launches tmux sessions at directories.

```bash
dirsesh at <path>
```

The `path` argument can be:
- a specific path:
```bash
dirsesh at "$HOME/code/project_name"
```
- or even the result of a command:
```bash
# your current working directory
dirsesh at "$(pwd)"
# the root of the repo you are currently in
dirsesh at "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
# a fresh scratch directory
dirsesh at "$(mktemp -d)"

# Use a fuzzy finder to make commands interactive
# fuzzy find directories in your HOME folder
dirsesh at "$(find $HOME -type d | fzf)"
# fuzzy find worktrees of the current git repo
dirsesh at "$(git worktree list | fzf | awk '{print $1}')"
# Search your most-used directories
dirsesh at "$(zoxide query -i)"
```

### Session creation

Once a directory is passed to `dirsesh at <path>`, every session is created the same way:

1. **Does a session already exist for that directory?**

    Switch to it.

    A session is identified by the directory it started at, not by its name. `dirsesh` records
    that directory on the session in the `@dirsesh_path` tmux option and compares against that.
    Sessions `dirsesh` did not create have no `@dirsesh_path` and fall back to tmux's `#{session_path}`,
    so a plain `tmux new-session` at that directory is found too.

    This makes `dirsesh at` idempotent, preventing multiple sessions from being created
    at the same directory even if a session has been renamed.

2. **Does a configuration claim that directory?**

    Use that configuration when creating/naming the session.

    See [Configured Sessions](docs/configured-sessions.md) for details on how to customize sessions.

3. **Otherwise:**

    Create a plain session named after the directory.

### Session teardown

A session built by a configuration's `start` should always get its matching `kill`. `dirsesh`
therefore hangs teardown off a `session-closed` hook rather than a command, so `kill` is
invoked whether you kill the session explicitly or its last pane simply exits:

```bash
# Add this to ~/.tmux.conf to install the hook
run-shell "dirsesh init"
```

That last case is the one that matters, and it is why there is no session-killing command to
parallel `dirsesh at`. A shell exiting closes the session without anything asking `dirsesh` to.
Sessions killed outside of `dirsesh`'s control are still handled correctly.

The hook fires for every session tmux closes but it acts only on sessions `dirsesh at` built from
a configuration. Everything else closes exactly as it would on a server with no `dirsesh` on it.

## Usage

```bash
# Show help message
dirsesh

# Start or switch to session at a directory
dirsesh at <path> [-c] [-p]
  -c, --no-config          # Ignore any configuration claiming that path
  -p, --prompt-name        # Prompt for the session name instead of using the default

# Configurations claiming a path (defaults to the current directory)
dirsesh match [path]

# Install the hook that cleans up configured sessions (put this in tmux.conf)
dirsesh init
```

## Workflow

See [Workflow](docs/workflow.md) for an example of how to integrate `dirsesh` into
your day-to-day setup.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanburda/tmux-dirsesh/main/install.sh | sh
```

The install script:
- clones the repository to `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/tmux-dirsesh`
- symlinks `dirsesh` into `~/.local/bin`.

Re-run it any time to update.

<summary><strong style="font-size: 1.25em;">Custom Installation</strong></summary>

Two environment variables change where things land: `DIRSESH_HOME` (where the repo is cloned) and
`BIN_DIR` (where the `dirsesh` symlink goes).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanburda/tmux-dirsesh/main/install.sh \
  | DIRSESH_HOME=~/src/dirsesh BIN_DIR=~/bin sh
```

Or manually: clone the repo, symlink `dirsesh` into a directory on your PATH.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanburda/tmux-dirsesh.git ~/git/tmux-dirsesh
ln -s ~/git/tmux-dirsesh/dirsesh ~/.local/bin/dirsesh
```

<summary><strong style="font-size: 1.25em;">Shell Completions</strong></summary>

Completions cover subcommands, their flags, and directories. Paths below assume the install script's checkout location; substitute your own if you
cloned elsewhere.

**Bash**: add to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
source ~/.local/share/tmux-dirsesh/completions/dirsesh.bash
```

**Zsh**: add to `~/.zshrc` (or rename `dirsesh.zsh` to `_dirsesh` in an existing fpath directory):

```bash
fpath=(~/.local/share/tmux-dirsesh/completions $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

**Fish**:

```bash
ln -s ~/.local/share/tmux-dirsesh/completions/dirsesh.fish ~/.config/fish/completions/
```
